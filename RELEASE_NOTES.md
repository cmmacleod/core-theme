#Upgrading to the Mozu Core 9 Theme

Core 9 is the latest version of the Mozu Core theme. It was introduced with the Mozu November 2015 Service Update.

**Note:** The Base Blank theme has been deprecated. You should use the Mozu Core theme instead.

##HOW TO UPGRADE YOUR THEME
You can use the [Mozu Theme Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-mozu-theme) to update a legacy theme to include changes in this version of Core. You can also run the generator in an empty directory to clone these files as the basis for a brand new theme. 

When you run the Mozu Theme Generator, the tools create a git remote to the Mozu [core-theme](https://github.com/Mozu/core-theme/tree/master) repository. In the future, you can open a terminal or command prompt and run:

`grunt mozutheme:check` 

in your local theme directory to check for updates to the Core theme.
